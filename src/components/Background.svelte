        Despite the government's interventions in addressing poverty, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) Undersecretary 
        and National Statistician Dennis Mapa stated that over 25.24 million Filipinos remain under the poverty line. Within this 
        population, over 9.79 million of Filipinos are unable to meet their basic food needs. Moreover, the National Economic and 
        Development Authority (NEDA) estimated that around 7.2 million Filipinos are unable to escape poverty as they are trapped 
        by the inflation rate in the country. Moreover, the recent COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated the issue, pushing many 
        more into poverty.
